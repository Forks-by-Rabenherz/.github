# 🍴 Forks by Rabenherz

> *Where forks go to live their best life (and stay synced)*

Welcome to my fork sanctuary! This is where GitHub repositories come when they need:
- **Witness Protection** - Hiding from my main profile because, let's be honest, 666 repos is a bit much
- **Sync Therapy** - Keeping up with their upstream parents (no commitment issues here!)
- **Backup Plans** - Because the cloud is just someone else's computer, and I trust MY computer (most of the times)

## Fun Facts

> *WIP...*

<!-- MARKER:STATS-START -->

- Average time between fork and last sync: *checks notes* ...perfect!
- Number of repos actually contributed to: Let's not talk about it
- Disk space used for backups: Yes.
- Regrets: None. This is art.

LOL. This is MY fork dumping ground. Get your own! 😄
